								<h3 class="major" id="aqua">PROJECT AQUARTLE</h3>
								<p>Welcome to my exhibition of projects!  In here, there are mostly academic projects which I undertake in my academic journey. Apart from my projects, you can also take a look at projects I did during my <a href="#work" style="color: darkgoldenrod">working experiences!</a>.</p>
								<p>First of all, let me introduce the most interesting project I ever did in my journey thus far! Yes! That is the above picture that you see, Project AQUARTLE. Project AQUARTLE is an Anti-drowning Life Saving Underwater Drone Robot.</p>
								<p>In this project, my role was a mechanical engineer. I designed and ideated the design of the robot. I was also in charge of the prototyping, especially the waterproofing of the electronics. Throughout the project, the whole team was fully involved at every stage such that each member understands the whole process. It is no doubt one of the best projects I have ever done!</p>
								<p>Take a look at the video on how AQUARTLE works below!</p>
								<video width="100%" style="border-radius: 4px" controls="controls" src="videos/Aquartle.mp4."></video>

								<h3 class="major" id="nowit">NOW: IT</h3>
								<img width= "45%" height = "80%"  style="margin-left:2rem" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/NOW.jpg">
								<span><img width= "45%" height = "80%" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/NOW.gif"></span>
								<p>NOW is an entrepreneurship startup which my team and I came up with during our Entrepreneurship module! In that company, I undertook the role of a Chief Strategy Officer. I oversee the company directions and plan ahead for the project. Apart from just planning, I was also involved in designing and prototyping the product.</p>
								<p>IT is NOW's very first product. It is an effective timer that practices the pomodoro technique to deliver users productivity and work balance. Head to <a href="https://the-now-co.com/" title="Find out more about IT NOw!" target="_blank" style="color: darkgoldenrod"> NOW's website</a> to find out more about it!</p>
								<p>NOW's product IT also made its attempt at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/now-it/it-your-personal-portable-productivity-partner" target="_blank" style="color:darkgoldenrod"> kickstarter</a>. It was a great learning journey for the team attempting to market the product overseas! </p>

								<h3 class="major" id="odine">'O'-Dine</h3>
								<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/Odine.jpg">
								<p>Project 'O'-Dine is a project done with the intention to improve current cleaning system or procedure in hawker centres and food courts. 'O'-Dine is designed with a covered bin in the middle which directs dirty dishes and food waste on the table on to a conveyor belt which will transport the waste to a central chute.</p>
								<img width= "45%" height = "80%"  style="margin-left:2rem" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/Odineposter.jpg">
								<span><img width="45%" height="80%" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/Odine2.jpg"> </span>	
								<p>In this project, I took up the role of designing and building the prototype, from the CAD-ing stage to the realization of the physical prototype. The most interesting part of this process is when the team worked together to build a conveyor belt from scratch, we were delighted when it turned out to be successful!</p>
							
								<h3 class="major" id="ascenditur">Ascenditur</h3>
								<img width="45%" height="80%" style="margin-left:2rem" style="border-radius: 4px" src= "images/Ascenditur.jpg">
								<span><img width="45%" height="80%" style="border-radius: 4px" src="images/ascenditurshowcase.jpg"></span>
								<p>Ascenditur is a wearable grip assistant exoskeleton that helps the user to enhance their grip through the use of force resistor sensor and a linear actuator paired with an Arduino microcontroller. My team and I worked and developed a few ideas on it in a design module we took in our first year in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). In this project, I took the role of prototyping the few different design ideas we brainstormed and sketched all the different use case scenarios and designs. Take a look at the sketches and video below! </p>

								<h3 class="major" id="parkingday">PARK(ing) Day</h3>
								<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/nightfest.png">
								<p>PARK(ing) Day is an annual worldwide event where community members transform parking spots into vibrant public spaces for one day. My team participated in PARK(ing) day, designing decorative letterboxes for strangers to interact and give gifts to one another. This project was then subsequently featured in Singapore University of Technology and Design's Night Festival, SUTD's NightFest! I was involved with all the sketching and woodwork which were truly satisfying when the installation was assembled!"  </p>

								<p>ARTAS is an augmented reality art exhibition mini project created by my team during a hackathon organized by Singapore University of Technology and Design. The design is split into five different art images with different content to showcase the potential in futuristic augmented art in different aspects of the industry. 2 of the images showcase architectural potential where a blueprint of a floorplan will be reflected when detected by the camera. The other 3 images are a rotating earth, a hand to help someone in need for social awareness and lastly, a floating optical illusion. </p>  
							
								<h3 class="major" id="ieee">IEEE OPENHOUSE MUSIC-INTERACTING LED</h3>
								<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/ieeeproto.jpg">
								<p>In one of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)'s openhouses, I ideated and designed along with a team of IEEE club members to come up with a LED installation which interacts with music. The colours and brightness will change accordingly to the intensity of the music! In this project, I took the role of ideating this idea, sketching the proposed design and subsequently building the prototype! Take a look at the pictures and videos below on how the product comes to life!</p>

								<p>Welcome to my working experience journey! In here, I will showcase the projects that I was fortunate to participate in during my working journey. I hope to explore more and learn more skills to add on to my working experience!</p>
								
								<h3 class="major" id="mondelez">MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL</h3>
								<p>Mondelez International is one of the leading confectionery and snacking company in the world. The company produces famous household brands like Oreos, Cadbury, HALLS, Sour Patch Kids, Toblerone and many other more!</p>
								<p>My journey in Mondelez International was an interesting and unforgettable one. I started off as an R&D Packaging Intern during my summer internship programme. My department was made up of people from all over the world, an international team! As an R&D Packaging Intern, my role was to design new art and packaging, correct designs as well as test engineering product specifications. I was even involved in tasting and packing in their laboratory! </p>
								<p>Throughout my 4 months of internship, I managed to create over 20 prototypes for the team and completed tasks crucial for certain projects. I also wrote and developed a Standard Operating Procedure manual for the team's prototyping laboratory after going through training for almost all equipment and machinery in the laboratory. </p>
								<p>My performance in Mondelez had given me the opportunity to continue as a part-time freelance designer for the team despite being in school, which extended my collaboration with the team for another 2 months. In the 2 months, one of the many prototypes which I designed eventually got launched to the Japan market! Take a look at the photos below on my journey in Mondelez!</p>

								<p>In collaboration with Live Well Collaboration and Singapore Polytechnic, I had the opportunity to work in a project under Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to collect data on Taichung's Bus Rapid Transit and formulate the data to produce informative graphs. In the span of 2 months, I was fortunate to be given the opportunity to travel to Taichung to conduct data collection through experiments. At the end of the trip, I took up the role of formulating the data and presenting the graphs with my team to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>
							
								<h3 class="major" id="boeing">BOEING</h3>
								<img width="100%" style="border-radius: 4px" src = "images/boeing.jpg">
								<p>Even before the project I took under MITSUBISHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES, I was given my first opportunity under Live Well Collaboration and Singapore Polytechnic to work with BOEING. I participated in BOEING's "ADAPTABLE SPACE" studio project where I designed and created a mobile headrest with a multi-disciplinary team, which was then presented to BOEING at the end of the studio. In this trip, I even had the opportunity to travel to Hong Kong to conduct research on a flight!</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Pool.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Welcome to this page which shows the side of me outside studies and work! Apart from doing meaningful and interesting projects, I spend my free time playing pool, darts, video games, chess and listening to songs!<br>
								<h3 class="major" id="history">MY BRIEF HISTORY</h3>
								<p>First a brief introduction on me! (At least from the point where I really kinda knew what was really going on!) I started my primary education in RIVER VALLEY PRIMARY SCHOOL, completed the 6 years and then I went on to QUEENSTOWN SECONDARY SCHOOL where I happened to took on the role of a vice chairman in my co-curricular activity, Wushu, during my 4 years. 
								Moving on from there, I enrolled into Diploma in Engineering with Business in Singapore Polytechnic. In the 3 years, I studied one-third Mechanical Engineering, one-third Electrical Engineering and the remaining were Business modules which include Marketing, Finance, Economics, Project Management and many more. 
								I graduated with a Diploma with Merit, having achieved the 10% in cohort, and I enlisted in the same year and finished my 2 years of national service as an Artillery Auxiliary Instructor. The 2 years to me was meaningful as I was able to nuture future batches of cadets and impart the knowledge I have learnt to them. I was also fortunate to be included into revamping the course structure in my field as part of being an instructor due to my deep understanding of the course, which then led me to have a great working relations with my superiors. After the 2 years, i furthered my studies in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) till present and will be looking forward to start my full-time career some time soon!
								</p>
								<h3 class="major" id="hobbies">MY HOBBIES</h3>
								<p>Playing pool has been my passion since my secondary school years and I have even represented SUTD Pool's team for several competitions!
								I also do enjoy watching movies, especially horror and action movies, personally a fan of any superhero movies.
								I tend to also spend most of my free time listening to music, majority Chinese pop songs!<br>
								</p>
								<p>One of my favourite past hobbies was playing video games, especially First Player Shooting (FPS) games, as I feel that playing those games while growing up did nuture my spirit for teamwork and also taught me the importance of it.
								However, now I play much lesser and only especially if there are companions to play with. Apart from the "non-healthy" activities, I do get myself involved with sports time to time, such as basketball, badminton, table tennis and others.</p> 
								<h3 class="major" id="summary">SUMMARY OF ME</h3>
								<p>To sum it all and not bore you on this page, overall I am a person who loves to learn and try new things and is always keen to master the thing that I am doing. I am also pretty easy-going except that I am sometimes a perfectionist.</p>
